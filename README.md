# *Ganoderma lucidum* bioprocess microbiome analysis
This repository is for my G. lucidum bioprocess microbiome analysis project.

**Introduction**

Ganoderma lucidum is an ecologically and economically important wood-degrading fungus. From a economic perspective, *G. lucidum* is cultivated for numerous applications, such as medicinal and material. The bioprocess used to grow the fungus--often, a solid-state fermentation--is increasingly understood to harbor a rich microbiome that affects bioprocess outcomes and product characteristics.

This repository contains tools for studying the microbiome of various *G. lucidum* bioprocesses.
